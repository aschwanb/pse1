## Install requirements

### 1.i Install Ruby
We recommend to install ruby with a Manager such as Ruby Version Manager (RVM). This installation may conflict with prior ruby installations.
Full documentation is available [here](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).

Install RVM:
We advise a multiuser installation. That way you don't have to setup and configure the ruby environment for multiple users.

Install the stable version of RVM with the command

    \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable
Install Ruby Version 2.2.1

    rvm install 2.2.1
You can check the installation with

    ruby -v
Disable rdoc and ri installation for every gem by adding the following line to your ``~/.gemrc`` or ``/etc/gemrc``

    gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri

Install Rails Version 4.2.0

    gem install rails -v 4.2.0

### 1.ii MySQL Server
Install MySQL Server and thedatabase  development files

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server
    sudo apt get install libmysqlclient-dev

You can reset the root password with

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5

### 1.iii Phusion Passenger for Apache2
The Apache2 Webserver is most likely pre-installed, if not you can install Apache2 with

    sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc
Full installation documentation for Phusion Passenger can be found [here](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#installation).

You can install Passenger via APT Repository or Gem:

    gem install passenger
The gem only contains source files. You need to run the installer:

    passenger-install-apache2-module
Check if Apache loads Passenger

    sudo a2enmod passenger
Verify that Passenger is running

    passenger-memory-stats

## Deploy application 

### 2.i  Configure Apache
Deploy the application to ``/var/www/webapp`` or another directory. You need to create an Host file for Apache. Browse to ``/etc/apache2/sites-available``

Create a new file ``ror.conf`` containing the lines
  
    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName pse1.iam.unibe.ch
      DocumentRoot /var/www/webapp/public
      Alias /phpmyadmin /var/www/phpmyadmin
      <Directory /var/www/webapp/public>
        Allow from all
        Options -MultiViews
        PassengerAppEnv development
        # Uncomment this if you're on Apache >= 2.4:
        #Require all granted
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
The variable ``PassengerAppEnv`` defines the ruby Environment. For more information see [here](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#PassengerAppEnv).

### 2.ii Passenger restart coniguration
Passenger needs a file called ``restart.txt`` to be able to automatically restart (e.g if you use continouse integration).
Browse to the applicatipon directory ``/var/www/webapp`` and create a tmp directory and a restart file:

    mkdir tmp
    touch tmp/restart.txt
The file doesn't need to have any content.

### 2.iii Permissions
The Spring gem needs to write to ``/tmp``. You need to change the directory permissions if the spring gem is denied access:

    sudo chmod 1777 -R /tmp
(not 777 nor tmp/)

### 2.iv Install missing gems
Browse to the application root ``webapp/``. In the terminal type

    bundle install

## 3 Application configuration

### 3.i Secrets File
A secrets file named ``secrets.yml`` must be present in ``webapp/config`` and contain the Twitter keys in addition to the secret key base:

    twitter_client_consumer_key: ****
    twitter_client_consumer_secret: ****
    twitter_client_access_token: ****
    twitter_client_access_token_secret:****

### 3.ii Database connection & rake
The database connection can be configured in the file ``database.yml`` located in ``webapp/config``. Our default configuration is:

    adapter: mysql2
    pool: 5
    timeout: 5000
    username: root
    password: root
    encoding: utf8mb4
    collation: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
If you have trouble connecting to the DB, you may specifie the socket path:

    socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
The socket path may vary.
In the application root path ``·∫Åebapp/`` you can invoke rake to create your DB tables with

    rake db:create
If you need to reset the DB type

    rake db:reset

### 3.iii Cron Job
If you have configured the application you can invoke the cron job. Browse to the application directory ``/var/www/webapp`` and run in the terminal

    whenever --update-crontab MegaUltraTweet
You can check the cron jobs with

    crontab -l
and edit them with

    crontab -e
or directly in the file ``webapp/config/shedule.rb`` .The cron log file is located in ``webapp/log/``



### 3.iv Application settings and variables
The application settings can be changed by setting the global variables in webapp/config/application.rb.

    # Global Variables
    # These values will be initiated as the first hashtags
    # They are always part of the first Startingpoint object
    DEFAULT_STARTING_VALUES = %w[ Technology Smartphone ]
    # Only tweets since this date are taken into account when searching twitter
    TWEETS_SINCE_STRING = 2.days.ago.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    # Short rollover is performed every n minutes
    INTERVAL_SHORT_TIME = 15.minutes
    # Long rollover is performed every n days
    INTERVAL_LONG_TIME = 2.days
    # Popularity class returns times of usage of an object for this many short rollover entries
    # Time interval should be consistent with INTERVAL_SHORT_TIME
    POPULARITY_SHORT_INTERVAL = 1
    # Popularity class returns times of usage of an object for this many short rollover entries
    # Time interval should be consistent with INTERVAL_LONG_TIME
    POPULARITY_LONG_INTERVAL = 192
    # This many hashtags are included in the top/bottom statistic
    # used by the Trending object
    TRENDING_HASHTAGS_NUMBER = 20
    # This many hashtags are added to the Startingpoint object
    HASHTAG_TO_START_NUMBER = 30
    # Maximum number of hashtags in Startingpoint object
    HASHTAG_TO_START_MAX = 80
    # Recursive steps taken during search
    QUERY_DEPTH = 5
    # Number of hashtags to start a new query during search
    QUERY_DETAIL = 10
    # Get this many tweets from twitter for each search
    GET_THIS_MANY = 400
    # All tweets older than this are removed during rollover
    DELETE_OLDER_TWEETS = 3.days.ago
    # Search during rollover will stop after this many searches
    # Add some buffer for user input. Max searches provided by twitter is at 450
    PROVIDED_SEARCHES = 400
    # This is the limit as how many tweets in the DB are to be considered. Set to nil to disable.
    DB_SEARCH_LIMIT = 3000
    # Save and analyse tweet only if rank is higher than this value
    TWEET_RELEVANCE_MINIMUM = 1
